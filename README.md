# Segmentation_Images_Deep_Learning
The aim of this work is to segment images using  the "deep-learning" with caffe. 
The use of the Fully Convolutional Networks  allows to achieve  such semantic segmentation  of various clothing  images  around  18 regions, including basically the background, handbags, skin ...
